UNIT 3 – Study of List & Various Operations on it 

Aim: - 
 To study the concept of lists in Python and perform various operations such as insertion, deletion, slicing, etc. of list elements using Python programs. 

Tools Required: -
-	Google Colab 
-	GitHub 

Theory: -
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data. 
Lists are ordered, mutable, and can contain elements of different data types such as integers, floats, strings, and even other lists. 

Common List Operations: -
1.	Lists are created using square brackets. 
2.	Insertion Operations – append(), insert()
3.	Deletion operations – remove() 
4.	Finding length of the list – len()
5.	Arranging in ascending order – sort()
Etc. 



Conclusion: -
Thus, the study of lists and their various operations in Python was successfully performed. Lists provide an efficient way to store, access, and manipulate data. Understanding list operations is essential for solving real-world programming problems and forms the foundation for advanced data structures in Python.
